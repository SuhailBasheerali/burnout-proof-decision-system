## Framework Overview

The Burnout-Proof Decision Framework is based on a core principle:

**"Progress without burnout"**

Traditional decision frameworks focus on:
- ✅ Growth
- ❌ Sustainability (often ignored)

This framework focuses on:
- ✅ Growth (forward progress)
- ✅ Sustainability (ability to maintain)
- ⚖️ Balance between both

### The Three Dimensions

```
         GROWTH (forward progress)
            ↑ (0-100 scale)
            │
     80 ────┼──────────────→ ✅ EXECUTE_FULLY
     60 ────┼────────────→ ⏸️ STEADY_EXECUTION
     40 ────┼───→ 🔄 LIGHT_RECOVERY OR ⏱️ TIME_BOX
     20     │
      0     └──────────────────────────→ SUSTAINABILITY
             0   20   40   60   80  (0-100 scale)
```

### Core Premise

An option might look good on **growth alone**:
- "We'll grow 200% if we take on this project"
- **But**: Can the team sustain it? Will people burn out?

This framework makes sustainability **visible and weighted**.

---

## The Five Zones

### Zone 1: EXECUTE_FULLY ✅
**Growth ≥70 AND Sustainability ≥70**

```
Characteristics:
- Both dimensions strong
- Minimal burnout risk
- High structural integrity
- Team will be healthy AND growing

Examples:
- Launching feature with adequate resources
- Hiring campaign with strong culture
- Market expansion with team capacity
- Efficiency improvement that reduces work
```

**Recommendation**: 
```
🚀 FULL SPEED AHEAD

Execution Strategy:
- Commit fully with confidence
- Accelerated timeline acceptable
- Monitor for leading burnout indicators weekly
- Maintain current pace until sustainability dips below 65
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Team engagement scores remain high
- Turnover stays normal
- Quality metrics maintained
- Deadlines met with manageable effort

**Risk If Ignored**:
- Complacency → Miss optimization opportunities
- Momentum loss → Could have gone faster

---

### Zone 2: TIME_BOX ⏱️
**Growth ≥70 AND Sustainability <50**

```
Characteristics:
- High momentum but unsustainable
- Classic "sprint" scenario
- Team will be exhausted afterward
- Viable for LIMITED DURATION ONLY

Examples:
- Aggressive product launch under deadline
- Crisis response (customer emergency, market opportunity)
- Aggressive fund-raising push
- Market capture race
- Career advancement sprint (e.g., new role transition)
```

**Recommendation**:
```
⏱️ SPRINT WITH RECOVERY PLAN

Critical Parameters:
- Set explicit time boundary (30-90 days typical)
- Define exit criteria (launch day, milestone, funding close)
- MANDATORY recovery period follows (30-60 days typical)
- Cannot sustain indefinitely

Execution Strategy:
1. Announce sprint duration explicitly ("90-day push")
2. Mobilize team for intensive effort
3. Relax secondary priorities
4. Plan celebration at finish line
5. Schedule recovery before next sprint
```

**Recovery Plan**:
```
During Recovery (Post-Sprint):
- Reduce new commitment rate by 50%
- Focus on technical debt reduction
- Rebuild team morale & relationships
- Process documentation & standardization
- Mental health check-ins
- 2-3 week vacation time for key people
```

**Time-Box Duration Rules**:
```
Sprint Duration → Recovery Duration → Safe Repeat?
2 weeks sprint → 1 week recovery → Every week OK
4 weeks sprint → 2 weeks recovery → Monthly OK
12 weeks sprint → 4-6 weeks recovery → Quarterly OK
```

**Signs You're Doing It Right**:
- Team knows the end date
- There's a visible recovery phase planned
- Metrics show stress, but within limits
- People aren't working unsustainable hours (>60 hr/week) repeatedly

**Red Flags**:
- Team has lost sight of end date
- No recovery phase in sight
- Working 70+ hours multiple weeks in a row
- Attrition starts showing up
- Decision maker says "Oh, this will just be 2 more weeks..." for the 5th time

---

### Zone 3: LIGHT_RECOVERY 🔄
**Growth <50 AND Sustainability ≥70**

```
Characteristics:
- Strong stability, lower momentum
- Building capacity for future
- Anti-fragile positioning
- Post-burnout recovery phase

Examples:
- After aggressive sprint → consolidation quarter
- Technical debt elimination project
- Team expansion/hiring phase
- Process documentation/standardization
- Culture rebuilding after turnover
- "No-new-features" maintenance mode

Frequency: Should occur every 3-4 months after sprints
```

**Recommendation**:
```
🔄 CONSOLIDATION MODE

Purpose:
- Repair from previous sprints
- Build organizational resilience
- Set foundation for next growth cycle
- Invest in capabilities

Execution Strategy:
1. Reduce growth targets explicitly (communicate why)
2. Deploy team to:
   - Technical debt reduction
   - Process improvements
   - Documentation
   - Team skill development
   - Mentoring junior members
3. Celebrate "invisible work"
4. Build buffer capacity

Acceptable Activities:
- Small improvements, bug fixes
- Maintenance and support
- Training and skill development
- Internal tool building
- Team bonding
- Recovery time

Unacceptable Activities:
- Major new feature launches
- Large customer commitments
- Aggressive hiring
- Rapid scope expansion
```

**Success Metrics**:
```
Trending Upward (Good):
- Technical debt metrics improve
- Documentation completeness increases
- Team velocity stabilizes
- Employee satisfaction increases
- Process adherence improves

Concerning Trends:
- Team is bored/disengaged
- No tangible output visible
- Momentum loss too severe
- Team wants to leave

If Concerning: It's too long, move to next growth cycle
```

**Duration**:
- Minimum: 2-4 weeks (after 2-week sprint)
- Typical: 4-12 weeks (after 3-month sprint)
- Maximum: 6-9 months only in post-crisis situations

---

### Zone 4: STEADY_EXECUTION ⏸️
**Moderate Growth AND Moderate Sustainability**

```
Characteristics:
- Balanced, sustainable pace
- "Business as usual" with progress
- No crisis, no stagnation
- Long-term viable

Examples:
- Normal iteration cycles
- Regular feature delivery
- Ongoing projects
- Stable business operations
- Quarterly planning and execution

Frequency: Most common state (should be 50%+ of time)
```

**Recommendation**:
```
⏸️ MAINTAIN CURRENT PACE

Execution Strategy:
- Continue normal operations
- Deliver planned scope on schedule
- Monitor sustainability metrics
- Look for optimization opportunities
- Be aware of drift into TIME_BOX (watch sustainability)

Acceptable Activities:
- Planned project work
- Regular feature delivery
- Scheduled improvements
- Resource optimization
- Performance monitoring

Batching:
- Weekly team syncs
- Monthly retrospectives
- Quarterly planning

Warning Signs:
- If sustainability drops below 50 → Shift to TIME_BOX precautions
- If growth drops below 30 → Consider if right strategy
- If both flatten → Adjust strategy
```

---

### Zone 5: AVOID ❌
**Growth <40 AND Sustainability <40**

```
Characteristics:
- Weak structural integrity
- Insufficient value in both dimensions
- Not worth the effort
- High risk, low return

Examples:
- Unfocused project with unclear benefits
- Technology choice that creates debt
- Organizational structure that works against you
- Process that creates busywork
- Initiative no one believes in
```

**Recommendation**:
```
❌ REJECT OR FUNDAMENTALLY REDESIGN

Options:
1. Don't do it → Defer indefinitely
2. Redesign it → Increase growth targets (be ambitious)
                  Increase sustainability (build for long-term)
                  Find different approach
3. Find alternative → Is there better way to achieve goal?

If Forced to Proceed:
- Understand you're making a conscious trade-off
- Have compelling reason (legal, strategic, customer)
- Plan exit strategy
- Minimize team exposure (don't let it consume entire roadmap)
- Convert to TIME_BOX eventually
```

**Redesign Prompts**:
```
"This currently has low growth. How could we:
- Expand scope?
- Increase ambition?
- Make it more strategic?"

"This currently has low sustainability. How could we:
- Reduce complexity?
- Lower team burden?
- Make it more maintainable?
- Automate it?"

Result: Resubmit to evaluation framework
```

## Risk Level System

Risk levels identify **what could go wrong** and the severity.

### STRUCTURALLY_STABLE ✅

**Meaning**: Balanced decision, low burnout risk

**Characteristics**:
- Growth ≥ 60 and Sustainability ≥ 60
- Tension index is LOW or MODERATE
- Team has capacity
- Risk factors are minimal

**What to Do**:
- Proceed with confidence
- Focus on execution quality
- Monitor for deviations, but not critical

**Example**:
```
Growth: 75, Sustainability: 78
Tension: 3 (excellent balance)
Risk: STRUCTURALLY_STABLE ✅
→ Healthy, sustainable decision
```

---

### SEVERE_BURNOUT_RISK ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Meaning**: High growth demands exceed sustainability capacity

**Characteristics**:
- Growth ≥ 75 AND Sustainability < 35, OR
- Growth ≥ 70 AND Sustainability < 50 AND Tension CRITICAL

**What to Do**:
1. **IF ALREADY COMMITTED**: Time-box it
   - Set explicit end date (90 days max)
   - Plan recovery period (4-6 weeks mandatory)
   - Do not enter recovery into "business as usual"
   
2. **IF NOT COMMITTED YET**: Redesign
   - Reduce growth targets, OR
   - Invest in sustainability first, OR
   - Find different approach

**Burnout Trap Example**:
```
Growth: 94, Sustainability: 33
Tension: 61 (critical imbalance)
Risk: SEVERE_BURNOUT_RISK ⚠️

Composite Score: 43.73/100 (heavily penalized)

Message: "Burnout trap detected - high growth demands exceed sustainability capacity"

Recommendation: Time-box for 12 weeks, then mandatory 6-week recovery
```

---

### SUSTAINABILITY_DEFICIT ⚠️

**Meaning**: Team doesn't have capacity to execute

**Characteristics**:
- Sustainability score < 40
- Usually accompanied by moderate-to-high growth targets
- Team is at/near breaking point

**What to Do**:
1. **Increase capacity first**: 
   - Hire support
   - Delegate/outsource
   - Upgrade tools/process
   - Reduce scope
   
2. **Then execute**:
   - With improved sustainability, re-evaluate
   
3. **Or reduce growth targets**:
   - What's actually achievable at current capacity?

**Example**:
```
Growth: 60, Sustainability: 25
Risk: SUSTAINABILITY_DEFICIT ⚠️

Analysis: Team is overextended
Action: Hire 2 engineers first, then re-evaluate
```

---

### GROWTH_STAGNATION_RISK ⚠️

**Meaning**: Insufficient progress toward goals

**Characteristics**:
- Growth score < 40 (except in LIGHT_RECOVERY zone)
- Initiative not ambitious enough
- Value creation is marginal

**What to Do**:
1. **Increase ambition**:
   - What would make this 2x more impactful?
   - Can scope be expanded?
   - Are there adjacent opportunities?
   
2. **Or deprioritize**:
   - Not worth doing if value is low
   - Free up capacity for high-impact work

**Example**:
```
Growth: 35, Sustainability: 60
Risk: GROWTH_STAGNATION_RISK

Current state: Safe but low-value
Question: Are there related initiatives with 2x impact?
Action: Either redesign for higher impact, or stop
```

---

### LOW_STRUCTURAL_VALUE ⚠️

**Meaning**: Weak in both dimensions

**Characteristics**:
- Growth < 40 AND Sustainability < 40
- Neither growth nor sustainability adequate
- Should be AVOIDED entirely

**What to Do**:
- Don't do it
- Redesign fundamentally, OR
- Find alternative approach
- If forced to proceed: explicitly understand trade-offs

---

### SEVERE_IMBALANCE (Internal Risk)

**Meaning**: Lopsided approach (not primary classification, but noted)

**Characteristics**:
- Tension index > 50
- One dimension much stronger than other
- Unstable long-term

**Mitigation**:
- If high-growth, low-sustainability: Use time-box approach
- If low-growth, high-sustainability: Good recovery mode
- Aim to rebalance over time

---

## Tension Severity Scale

### Purpose
Quantifies how imbalanced a decision is.

```
Tension Index = |Growth Score - Sustainability Score|
```

### Interpretation

| Tension | Severity | Meaning | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| 0-15 | **LOW** | Well-balanced | G:75, S:72 |
| 15-30 | **MODERATE** | Some trade-offs | G:75, S:50 |
| 30-60 | **HIGH** | Significant imbalance | G:85, S:45 |
| 60-100 | **CRITICAL** | Severe imbalance, burnout risk | G:95, S:30 |

### Low Tension (Balanced)
```
Growth: 75 | Sustainability: 78
Tension: 3 (LOW) ✅

Characteristics:
- Both strong and similar
- Team has capacity for growth
- Healthy, sustainable pace
- Long-term viable

Execution Style: Normal pace, accelerate gradually
```

### Moderate Tension
```
Growth: 75 | Sustainability: 50
Tension: 25 (MODERATE)

Characteristics:
- Growth opportunities but sustainability concerns
- Need to manage carefully
- Possible sprint after preparation

Execution Style: Prepare carefully, consider time-boxing
```

### High Tension
```
Growth: 85 | Sustainability: 40
Tension: 45 (HIGH)

Characteristics:
- Significant imbalance
- Growth push with strained resources
- Time-box is mandatory
- Recovery must follow

Execution Style: Sprint + Recovery cycle essential
```

### Critical Tension
```
Growth: 95 | Sustainability: 30
Tension: 65 (CRITICAL) ⚠️

Characteristics:
- Severe burnout trap
- Unsustainable without intervention
- Risks team health, quality, attrition
- Must be time-boxed with recovery

Execution Style: 60-90 day sprint only, then mandatory recovery
```

---

## Stability Classification

### Purpose
Measures how **robust** a decision is to changes in criteria.

### How It Works
System perturbs each criterion weight by ±20% and measures variance in composite score.

```
If perturbing weights slightly changes the decision → FRAGILE
If decision remains stable → STABLE
```

### Interpretation

| Stability | Variance | Robustness | Action |
|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **STABLE** | <8 | Very robust | Trust the decision |
| **MODERATELY_STABLE** | 8-20 | Fairly robust | Track key metrics |
| **FRAGILE** | >20 | Low robustness | Verify assumptions |

### STABLE 🟢
```
Example:
- G: 75, S: 75, Sensitivity: 2.3
- Even if growth weights are wrong by 20%, decision holds
- Even if sustainability weights change, conclusion same

Interpretation:
- Assessment is solid
- Criteria weighting is reasonable
- Safe to proceed with confidence
- Focus on execution, not re-evaluation
```

### MODERATELY_STABLE 🟡
```
Example:
- G: 75, S: 50, Sensitivity: 14.5
- If growth weights are high, stronger feeling to proceed
- If growth weights are low, more cautious

Interpretation:
- Assessment is reasonable, but assumptions matter
- Verify key metrics during execution
- Be ready to adjust if metrics diverge
- Monitor top 2-3 criteria closely
```

### FRAGILE 🔴
```
Example:
- G: 55, S: 48, Sensitivity: 23.1
- Small changes in weight assumptions changes decision
- Marginal calls are unreliable

Interpretation:
- Decision is borderline
- Assumptions are tight
- Should NOT force this decision yet
- Either: clarify criteria OR reconsider approach
- If proceeding anyway, close monitoring required
```

## Real-World Applications

### Application 1: Product Launch Decision

**Scenario**: Launch new product line or postpone?

**Setup**:
```
Growth Criteria:
- Revenue opportunity: weight 10 (critical)
- Market share capture: weight 9 (critical)
- Strategic positioning: weight 7 (important)

Sustainability Criteria:
- Engineering capacity: weight 9 (critical)
- Sales/support readiness: weight 8 (very important)
- Quality standards (no debt spike): weight 8 (very important)
```

**Option A: Launch Now**
```
Growth: 88 (high opportunity)
Sustainability: 42 (team stretched)
Zone: TIME_BOX
Risk: SEVERE_BURNOUT_RISK
→ Recommendation: Launch in 60-day sprint, mandatory 4-week recovery

Success: Hit market window, then rebuild
Failure: Team burns out, quality drops, ship buggy product
```

**Option B: Launch in 6 Weeks**
```
Growth: 78 (good opportunity, slight delay)
Sustainability: 68 (better prep time)
Zone: EXECUTE_FULLY
Risk: STRUCTURALLY_STABLE
→ Recommendation: Full-speed launch, sustainable pace

Success: Launch with quality, team health intact
Failure: Market window closes
```

**Decision**: If market timing critical → Option A + time-box
If quality critical → Option B

---

### Application 2: Hiring & Team Expansion

**Scenario**: Hire 5 new engineers or 10?

**Option A: Hire 5**
```
Growth: 65 (steady growth)
Sustainability: 72 (manageable onboarding)
Zone: STEADY_EXECUTION
Risk: STRUCTURALLY_STABLE

Interpretation: Both pacing and quality maintained
```

**Option B: Hire 10**
```
Growth: 85 (stronger momentum)
Sustainability: 38 (onboarding chaos, mentoring bottleneck)
Zone: TIME_BOX
Risk: SEVERE_BURNOUT_RISK, SUSTAINABILITY_DEFICIT

Interpretation: Hiring blitz with 6-month integration chaos,
then recovery period to absorb and integrate
```

**Decision**: Choose B only if rapid scaling is strategic priority
Choose A for sustainable growth

---

### Application 3: Technical Debt Decision

**Scenario**: Refactor codebase (3-month project)?

**Option A: Massive Refactor (3 months)**
```
Growth: 25 (zero feature progress)
Sustainability: 95 (future-proof, better velocity ahead)
Zone: LIGHT_RECOVERY
Risk: GROWTH_STAGNATION_RISK (but strategic)

Good fit after: High-growth sprint (need recovery anyway)
Bad fit after: Stable growth phase (killing momentum)
```

**Option B: Incremental Refactor (ongoing, 1 hr/week)**
```
Growth: 85 (features keep shipping)
Sustainability: 72 (manageable tech improvement)
Zone: STEADY_EXECUTION
Risk: STRUCTURALLY_STABLE

Best fit: Working pace, consistent improvement
```

**Decision**: Use A after sprints (planned recovery)
Use B during normal cycles

---

### Application 4: Career Decisions (Individual)

**Scenario**: Take challenging new role?

**Option A: Current Role + Stability**
```
Growth: 35 (limited advancement)
Sustainability: 90 (healthy balance)
Zone: LIGHT_RECOVERY
Risk: GROWTH_STAGNATION_RISK

Implication: Safe but stagnant
```

**Option B: New Challenging Role**
```
Growth: 90 (career acceleration)
Sustainability: 35 (very demanding)
Zone: TIME_BOX
Risk: SEVERE_BURNOUT_RISK

Implication: Career leap, but 12-18 month grind
```

**Decision**: 
- Early career (age 22-32): Lean B, then recovery
- Mid career (age 32-45): Weigh both
- Late career (45+): Likely A, unless specific goal drives B
